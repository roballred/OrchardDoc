When you upload images using the rich-text editor in Orchard
(or using an XML-RPC client, such as [Windows Live Writer](http://explore.live.com/windows-live-writer)),
the images are saved in a _Media_ folder under the root of your Orchard installation.
The _Media_ folder must be writable (by the user process that's running the website) in order
for image uploads to succeed.
If you installed Orchard using the [Web Platform Installer](http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx),
the _Media_ folder write permissions are configured automatically.

To add and delete media folders, click **Media** in the dashboard.

Selecting an image file will allow you to view the following properties:


* **Screenshot** A thumbnail preview of the image content.
* **Last modified** How long since the media was modified and by whome.
* **Title** The tile of the media file
* **Filename** The name of the media file.
* **Mime Type** The file type of the media file.
* **Status** The published status of the media file.
* **Dimensions** Pixel width and height of the media file.



To edit media file properties select the media file and click on the edit button in the properties pane.

Editing a media file will allow you to change the following properties.
* **Title** The tile of the media file
* **Filename** The name of the media file.
* **Caption** The caption describes the media in a general context.
* **Alternate Text**. The html alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).
* **Owner** The username of the current owner of the media, which defaults to the username of the image creator.

To manage the subfolders for your media folder, click **Media** again on the dashboard.
Then click a folder to display the **Manage Folder** screen.

This screen gives you the options to add or delete media files and to create subfolders.

Click **Add a folder** to create a new subfolder.

Name the new subfolder (for example, name the subfolder "Pictures") and save it.

Browse to the new subfolder and click **Add media**.

Orchard lets you upload single media files as well as uploading a _.zip_ file that contains multiple image files.
If you have a large set of images to upload, it can be more efficient to first add them all to a _.zip_ file
and then just upload the _.zip_ file instead of uploading the images one by one. 

To see how this works, create a _.zip_ file on your computer that contains several image files,
and then click **Upload**. The **Extract zip** checkbox is selected by default,
which will cause the uploaded images in the _.zip_ to be extracted and added to the folder.

The uploaded and extracted images are displayed in their parent folder.

To see or edit the details of an individual uploaded image, click it.
